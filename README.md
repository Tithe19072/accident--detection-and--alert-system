# Course Title: Software Engineering

# Project proposal:Accident detection and alert system app

# INTRODUCTION

Developing an Accident Detection and Alert System App using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model involves several phases. SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining an information system. Here's a simplified guide using the traditional Waterfall SDLC model. Keep in mind that real-world projects often use Agile methodologies for flexibility.

# Steps of Waterfall model:


## 1.Requirement Gathering and analysis:
   - Work closely with healthcare professionals and stakeholders to gather detailed requirements for the e-healthcare app.
   
   - Define the features and functionalities needed for online consultation and medical subscription services.
## 2. System Design:
   - Develop a system architecture for the accident detection and alert system.
     
   - Create detailed technical specifications for the app.
     
   - Design the database schema.
     
   - Plan for the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

## 3. Implementation:
   - Write code for the accident detection algorithm and alert system.
     
   - Develop the mobile application for Android and/or iOS.
     
   - Integrate the app with necessary sensors (e.g., accelerometers, GPS).
     
   - Implement the backend server for processing and storing data.

## 4. Testing:
   - Perform unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.
     
   - Conduct integration testing to verify that all components work together.
     
   - Carry out system testing to evaluate the app as a whole.
     
   - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

## 5. Deployment:
   - Prepare for the app launch by configuring servers and databases.
     
   - Deploy the app to relevant platforms (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
     
   - Monitor the app's performance and address any issues that arise.

 ## 6. Maintenance and Support:
   - Address any post-launch issues or bugs promptly.
     
   - Gather user feedback for future updates and improvements.
     
   - Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the app.
